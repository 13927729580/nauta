# Deep Learning Studio for Enterprise

Deep Learning Studio for Enterprise (DLS4E) goal is to make the day-to-day life of a data scientist user simpler by
                                                        
* Provide state-of-the art configuration for doing Deep Learning on Intel hardware with the leading DL frameworks 
* Making hard things simpler without impeding low-level access for advanced users
* Reduce daily grind by automating mundane or repetitive tasks
* Provide additional control and insights into large scale DL activities

 
DLS4E consists of the following tools:
