# Network File System (NFS) Overview
 
The Network File System, or NFS allows a system to share directories and files with others over a network. The advantage of using NFS is that end-users as well as programs can access files on remote systems in the same way as local files. In addition, NFS uses less disk space, as it can be store data on a single machine while remaining accessible to others over a network.
