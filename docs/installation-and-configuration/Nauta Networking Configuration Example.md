# Networking Configuration Example

The Figure below shows an example Nauta Networking Diagram. While you can build a cluster with 1 machine to run all the examples and tests, you need at least 4 worker nodes (as shown in the example). The worker nodes should run Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5. All interfaces (both external and internal) are Ethernet interfaces.
