# Nauta Installation, Configuration and Administration Guide

This Nauta Installation, Configuration, and Administration guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing and configuring Nauta. This guide also provides an overview of Nauta requirements and configuration options.

**Note:** For instructions on configuring the Nauta client, refer to the Nauta User Guide.

Nauta is a software suite that provides a multi-user, distributed computing environment for running deep learning model training experiments. Results of experiments can be viewed and monitored using a command line interface (CLI), web UI and/or TensorBoard*. You can use existing data sets, your own data, or downloaded data from online sources, and create public or private folders to make collaboration among teams easier. 

Nauta runs on Kubernetes* and Docker* for scalability and ease of management. Nauta uses customizable templates  to take the complexities out of creating and running single and multi-node deep learning training experiments without all the systems complexity and scripting needed with standard container environments.
