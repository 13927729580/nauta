# Nauta for Enterprise

This Nauta Installation, Configuration, and Administration guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing and configuring Nauta. This guide also provides an overview of Nauta requirements, such as configuration management and operating system requirements.  

**Note:** For instructions on configuring the Nauta client, refer to the Nauta User Guide.

The Nauta software provides a multi-user, distributed computing environment for running deep learning model training experiments. Results of experiments, can be viewed and monitored using a command line interface (CLI), web UI and/or TensorBoard*. You can use existing data sets, use your own data, or downloaded data from online sources, and create public or private folders to make collaboration among teams easier. 

Nauta runs using the industry leading Kubernetes* and Docker* platform for scalability and ease of management. Templates are available (and customizable) on the platform to take the complexities out of creating and running single and multi-node deep learning training experiments without all the systems overhead and scripting needed with standard container environments.
